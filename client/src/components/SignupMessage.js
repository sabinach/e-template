              Emails for Justice
            </a>
            , making one's voice heard has never been easier â€” by clicking a
            link, one can contact institution leaders and government officials
            in a matter of seconds. Inspired by these activists' powerful use of
            technology, Sarah Yoon and Stephanie Yoon built an early version of
            e-Template: a tool that makes this kind of email templating simpler
            and more accessible.

          <p className="lead medium">
            Stephanie Yoon, Sabina Chen, Tess Gustafson, and Jonathan Wang
            introduce e-Template 2.0: a platform for not only creating, but also
            finding and publishing email templates. With a greatly expanded
            feature set and an intuitive user interface, e-Template makes
            digital activism easier than ever before.
